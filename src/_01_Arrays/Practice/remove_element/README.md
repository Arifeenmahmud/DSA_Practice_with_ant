The `removeElement` function takes an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`. It removes all occurrences of `val`
in `nums` in-place and returns the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`. It uses a two-pointer
approach to efficiently modify the array in-place and keep track of the count of elements not equal to `val`.
